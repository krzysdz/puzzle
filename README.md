## Usage
Before you start playing (or show the app to the children) you have to prepare an image

### Preparing image
1. Select an image by clicking "Kliknij aby wybrać plik" button (`.png`, `.jpg` and `.jpeg` are accepted)
2. To draw rectangles click on the image and move the cursor
3. When you release mouse button a rectangle will be drawn (it will cover all empty squares within selection)
4. You can use pattern - draw a rectangle with which you want to fill the image in pattern area. Click "Narysuj wzór" to fill the image with pattern. If you want to change pattern (clear pattern box) click "Wyczyść pole".
5. If you want to remove all rectangles from image (just reset it), click "Resetuj wszystko"

### Playing
In order to start playing you have to click "Graj" after [preparing image](#preparing-image)

To remove a rectangle doubleclick the rectangle you want to remove, its number or its entry on "Legenda:" list below the image

#### Example game
After preparing the image show it to the children (students). They will then tell you which rectangle to remove. While you are removing rectangles the children try to guess what's on the image below. The first one who guesses wins.
